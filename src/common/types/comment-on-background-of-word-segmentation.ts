On the first track of the *Red* album, [\"State of Grace:\"](https://genius.com/taylor-swift-state-of-grace-taylors-version-lyrics)\n\n>I’m walking fast through the traffic lights\nBusy streets and busy lives\nAnd all we know is touch and go\n\nAs well as [\"Holy Ground,\"](https://genius.com/taylor-swift-holy-ground-taylors-version-lyrics) the 11th track of the album, on which she sings:\n\n>Took off faster than a green light, go\nYeah, you skip the conversation when you already know\n\nTaylor has also explained talked about the meaning of this metaphor on an [interview](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/taylor-swift-gets-outspoken-i-have-no-idea-if-im-going-to-get-married/) with *Wonderland Magazine*'s \"Outspoken Issue,\" on which she stated:\n\n>Relationships are like traffic lights. And I just have this theory that I can only exist in a relationship if it’s a green light.",
